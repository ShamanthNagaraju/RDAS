2. Set the orintation of the node by setting ori_val in the "broadcast_eample.c" file
3. Right-click any node in the network window
4. Use the menu options to select Transmission Range and set the transmission range to 134 m and the interference range to 135 m to use default Rectangular Patch Antenna array (RPA) as directional antenna
5. Run

Refer the paper entitled "Realsitic Directional Antenna Suite for Cooja Simulator" from the following link for better understanding of the RDAS: https://doi.org/10.1109/NCC.2017.8077141. Also cite this paper while making using of RDAS for the simulation puropose.
